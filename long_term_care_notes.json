To start, the task force reports facility status in three ways: Outbreak in Progress, Pending Closure and Outbreak Closed. For cumulative data, all three are summed together by Nursing Homes, Assisted Living facility and multicare. In turn, the dashboard cumulative total is the long-term care totals. To remove any potential instances of double counting, the difference between the totals of the task force page categories combined and the cumulative total presented on the dashboard is the remaining cases and deaths obscured by Virginia’s  *. This remaining data is placed into the long-term care category. \n\nOutbreak data is reported for Nursing Homes, Assisted Living and multicare facilities. Current outbreak data is gathered from both “pending closure” and “outbreak-in-progress” facility statuses in the task force dataset. Virginia defines “pending closure” when a facility has 28 days passed without a documented new case and the outbreak has not yet been closed. An “outbreak-in-progress” is defined by Virginia as the identification of two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of illness, with onset dates within 14 days.\n\nJune 3, 2020: The Virginia Long-Term Care Task Force published its first dataset. \n\nJune 22, 2020: CTP began breaking out cumulative and outbreak cases and deaths by facility type.\n\nNovember 26, 2020: Number of Assisted Living Facilities with a COVID-19 case or death decreased by 2.","alerts":null},{"state":"VI","notes":"Virgin Islands does not release COVID-19 data for LTC facilities.","alerts":"Virgin Islands does not report COVID-19 data for long-term care facilities."},{"state":"VT","notes":"Vermont reports long-term care data for Assisted Living Facilities and behavioral health institutions.
